Cube Engine
===================
###what's this?###

<b>Cube Engine</b> is my own hobby porject, It's a small Graphic Engine written in c++ and powered by OpenGL (ES 2.0 or higher), I develop it so that I can improve my knowledges of CG and common programming Skills(generic algorithm ,code style ,design patterns).


Any questions or ideas please contact me: <br> tzwtangziwen@163.com <b>or</b> ziwen.tang@chukong-inc.com

###Features:###
1. Camera Control
2. Commons Model Format loading with Skeleton Animation
3. SkyBox
4. Terrain generate and render from HeightMap
5. Lighting (ambient ,diffuse ,specular)
6. NormalMapping
7. ShadowMapping with soft edges
8. deferred shading



###requirement###
* <b>libassimp:</b> If you use Windows, the project have a modified copy under the  <b>"cube/external"</b> folder
* <b>Qt framework and qt-creator:</b> only use if you compile with Qt
* Opengl ES 2.0 (forward shading) or 3.0(deffered shading)


###How to Build?###
* <b>Use Qt:</b> currently, I use Qt framework As a backend,so you need qt-creator.just use qt-creator open the file <b>cube.pro</b> in the <b>"cube"</b> folder and bulid it,when you finish ,drag the <b>"res"</b> folder to your build directory like <b>"build-cube-Desktop_Qt_XXXXX-Debug"</b>
* <b>without Qt:</b> you also can compile the cube engine without Qt, but you need modify the <b>backend.cpp</b>,and handle the delegate's by yourself,it's not too hard to switching the Qt backend to such like <b>GLFW</b> or <b>SDL</b>

###alpha v0.06 12.2.2014###
* Refactor lot's of code
* Fix the Terrain's default position

###alpha v0.05 11.24.2014###
