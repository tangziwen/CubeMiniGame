### What's This?

<b>Cube Engine</b> is my own hobby project, It's a small Graphic Engine written in c++ and powered by ~~OpenGL~~ and Vulkan, I develop it so that I can improve my knowledges of CG and common programming Skills(generic algorithm, code style, design patterns).

CubeEngine now is integrated with new script language tina.
